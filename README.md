## Code for my bots in Screeps game

Hi! So, there is a game called [Screeps](https://screeps.com/) it is "MMO sandbox game for programmers" according to their site. So basically you need to program virtual bots to build your base, and protect it from other players and evil bots. 
I cannot create folders, so don't be afraid of file names and project structure üòÖ.

### Gameplay
