## Code for my bots in Screeps game

Hi! So, there is a game called [Screeps](https://screeps.com/) it is "MMO sandbox game for programmers" according to their site. So basically you need to program virtual bots to build your base, and protect it from other players and evil bots. 
I cannot create folders, so don't be afraid of file names and project structure üòÖ.

### Gameplay 
You can watch right now what's going on in screeps world. Take a look! [https://screeps.com/a/#!/map/shard3?pos=6.409,-16.368](https://screeps.com/a/#!/map/shard3?pos=6.409,-16.368)
Here is a shout demo gif of how my bots are building my base:

And here towers are updating some constructions, and bots are updating controller, harvasting energy, and moving somewhere üòÅ.
